Demo of linux system programming, inline assembly and inter process communication using sockets. Due to the inline assembly this only works on 32-bit sytems. This code can be run either as a server process or client process. Clients send server commands to execute over sockets.


**The only reason this repository is public is for easy sharing with friends and hope that this code or snippet of it
might help somebody out there. I am not guaranteeing anything!**

With that said, feel free to ask questions and I will try to help you, or at least point you in the right direction.
